# Advent of Code

This repository has solutions to the 2020 programming challenges on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). 

I'm learning [Flutter](https://api.flutter.dev/index.html) and, therefore, Dart too. [Dart](https://dart.dev/) is the programming language used to develop Flutter apps.

I recently came across the Advent of Code. Attempting to solve the puzzles seemed a good way to learn a new programming language.

Sometimes the solutions seem verbose but I like to write code that you can read like prose and have some idea what's going on. Sometimes, I'm also trying to incorporate Dart features so that I can learn how to use them. For example, on Day 2, using named groups in the regular expressions was not necessary but it was good to learn their syntax.

Please feel free to suggest improvements, especially to make the code more Dart-like instead of the hybrid Java/JavaScript it tends to be whilst I learn Dart.

To run, go to directory `advent_of_code`:
```
cd bin
dart ./advent_of_code.dart
```

In file `bin/2020/year2020.dart`, comment out or uncomment the day(s) puzzles.

To enable assertions in dart:

```
dart --enable-asserts ./advent_of_code.dart
```

I wrote these on Windows 10 but Dart can run on Linux and macOS.
